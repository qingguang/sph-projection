INPUT_NAME: <PREFIX> of the input files
KERNEL_TYPE: kernel type, 1 - Quintic (SPH), 2 - Lucy kernel (SPH), 3 - M4, 4 - M6
TEST_CASE: boundary type, 1 - periodic, 2 - Lees-Edwards, 3 - periodic

phy_decay_turb.sz:
overlap (kappa): overlap factor (3.0, 3.5, 4.0), is not used for KERNEL_TYPE 3 and 4
step_start: the number of the first file to process (name of the file is <PREFIX><NUMBER>)
step_start: the number of the last file to process
num_particles: the number of particles

cutoff is calculated based on the number of particles 
cutoff = kappa * dx = kappa Lx/Nx, Lx length of the domain in x direction, 
Nx is the number of particles in x direction
